<h5>What <em><b>is</b></em> BBQ sauce?</h5>
<p>Barbecue, often abbreviated as BBQ,
                sauce is often used for basting, marinading, a condiment or for
                topping meat including pork or beef ribs and chicken. But BBQ
                sauce is so much more than a sauce. How is it that this sticky,
                brown sauce has captivated the hearts of so many people across
                the world? Where did it start and how far will it go? </p>
-->
<h5>What are the main ingredients?</h5>
<p>According to Allrecipes user
                <em>JRNEUMILLER</em>, BBQ sauce is made using ketchup, brown sugar,
                vinegar, water, various spices and seasonings including
                Worcestershire sauce, paprika, dry mustard, salt and black
                pepper, and dash of hot sauce (<em>allrecipes, 2023</em>). However, the
                sauce has much simpler origins: <em>Moss (2010)</em> states that early
                homemade BBQ sauce was made with vinegar, salt and pepper.</p>

<h5>Where did it originate?</h5>
<p>According to the Tennessee State
                Museum, the origins of barbecue sauce trace back to 1698 when
                P&egrave;re Labat, a Dominican missionary, saw French West
                Indies chefs barbecuing meat and using lime juice and hot
                peppers; they continue that it may have started in Africa, where
                lemon and lime was often used to marinade or baste meat
                (<em>Rothbarth, 2022</em>). <em>High Jr (2022)</em> states there are actually four
                variations of the sauce that have evolved over the years, the
                oldest being simply vinegar and pepper. Other variants include
                mustard, Light Tomato and Heavy Tomato. Vinegar and
                mustard-based sauces became popular in the American South in the
                1800s, when more people started experimenting with barbecue and
                as of today, America is well renowned for its love of barbecue
                (<em>Rothbarth, 2022</em>). As a result, barbecue sauce produces high
                sales in supermarkets. <em>Moran (2005)</em> observed in a study of
                condiments that 81% of participants preferred BBQ sauce as an
                accompaniment to ribs, chicken nuggets and chicken.</p>

<h5>Is there any cultural significance?</h5>
<p>Barbecuing as a cooking style has
                always been seen as a community, shared experience since it
                started (<em>Sugar, 2021</em>). It holds cultural significance in the way
                it has developed and changed over the centuries: Spanish
                colonisers brought over pigs to the Indigenous Peoples of the
                Caribbean and Florida Regions in the &lsquo;New World&rsquo;,
                which is now the Southern United States, who in turn started
                incorporating the animal in their slow cooking methods. The
                colonisers were met with a wide range of flavours spanning
                various continents: wine, vinegar and salt from Spain, sugar and
                molasses from the Caribbean, chilli peppers from Central America
                and tomatoes from South America (<em>Sugar.org, 2021</em>). The condiment
                is particularly special to North and South Carolina, where the
                vinegar and mustard base was predominantly used (<em>High Jr, 2022</em>).
                South Carolina has one of the largest barbecuing communities, so
                it is only right it is home to three of the four barbecue sauces
                used in America (<em>High Jr, 2022</em>).</p>

  <h5>Conclusion and Acknowledgements</h5>
<p>In
                conclusion, barbecue sauce is an extremely popular condiment,
                beloved to many for its sweet yet smoky taste and sticky
                texture. It adds a punch of flavour to smoked meats or even to
                just dip your chicken nuggets in.</p>
<p>Last, but certainly not least, I would like to
                specially reference and thank my boyfriend, Max Turner, for whom
                I would not have conducted this research without. You truly have
                broadened my horizons.</p>
