						<h2>Welcome</h2>
						<p>
							I am a young engineer eager to make my way into the design field with an overarching goal to gain the status of a Chartered Engineer. This page should give you an idea about who I am and what I'm all about. Due to recent events I am now looking for a position at an engineering company to work on designing the future.

						<h2>Skill Development</h2>
						<p> Through my years in education I have developed knowledge in both a technical aspect as well as interpersonal skills.
						<br><br>My A-Level Product Design project relied heavily on planning due to the limited time I had to complete my product. After researching possible construction methods and materials I could use, I planned each process using a Gantt Chart split into 15 minute blocks. This meant I could see clearly the order of manufacture as well as gauge the time I had to rework the design as I was manufacturing. I based the plan on dependencies between items so that there would be minimal time between component manufacture and construction meaning that I had room to edit processes as time went on. By constantly checking the master plans and diagrams I was able to keep a consistent level of quality in my work by ensuring each component i produced matched the specification.

						<br><br>As a personal project I have created a group with my friends to develop a computer game. This has tested my skills regarding time and people management to help focus on what needs work and what can be left in a lower state depending on how progress is being made. I work as the main designer to create assets for the game. I enjoy this role because it engages my creativity and the components I produce are directly visible in-game. Seeing my work pay off is very important to me.

						<br><br>During my time at Richmond upon Thames College I quickly formed a group mentality with new faces and have developed interpersonal skills. This was very important as we were able to play to each others strengths in group projects. At college I also produced 3-dimensional plans for my project in Inventor and 2D plans in AutoCAD. I also took it upon myself to teach lessons if the teacher was not in and I knew the subject matter.						
					<br><br>Over the course of each D of E award I have shown that I can plan effectively in a team and work to each members’ strengths during the expedition. By completing the expeditions it shows that I can persevere through difficult situations and stick to a plan. Besides the hiking DofE requires me to volunteer, learn new skills and complete physical activity. I volunteer for a St. Clares Hospice shop working behind the scenes restocking items and recording donations showing that I can maintain stock and allow the managers to work on more important bookkeeping tasks.
